# Mini-Shell

My project entails creating a mini shell, a compact version of a terminal, where I've implemented essential methods commonly used in the terminal environment. These methods include functionalities such as changing directories, listing directory contents, copying files, and more. With this mini shell, users can execute basic terminal commands efficiently within a simplified interface.
